    "# Snowflake Cortex Cost Monitoring and Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a robust set of examples for monitoring and analyzing costs associated with Snowflake Cortex LLM functions and Cortex Analyst. The examples use Snowflake's `ACCOUNT_USAGE` views and system tables to help administrators and analysts understand where credits are being consumed.\n",

    "\n",
    "- You must have the **ACCOUNTADMIN** role or a role with access to the `SNOWFLAKE` database and `ACCOUNT_USAGE` schema.\n",
    "- The `SNOWFLAKE` database should be visible in your session.\n",
    "- For analyst-specific monitoring, ensure that you have enabled and used Cortex Analyst in your account.\n",

    "Each section below contains SQL queries you can run directly in a Snowflake worksheet or notebook. Feel free to adjust date ranges (via `DATEADD`) and filters to suit your environment."
